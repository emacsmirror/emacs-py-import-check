# py-import-error

Emacs plugin which uses importchecker to find out the unused import in
the Python source code. It hits out the output in the grep buffer.

### Installation

I have distributed it through [Marmalade] (http://marmalade-repo.org)
but incase you want to install it manually, just use the
py-import-check.el file.

### Usage

You can invoke it through * py-import-check * function or
alternatively bind it to any key bindings.
